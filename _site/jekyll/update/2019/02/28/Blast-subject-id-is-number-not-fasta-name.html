    <p><strong>Overview</strong>
After recently using blastn for annotation, I came across an error that I had not received before. Instead of my subject id being the name of the sequence that I was using the subject id was a number. Although I was able to find someone with a similar issue on <a href="https://www.biostars.org/p/155573/">the biostars site</a> this didn’t appear to be an “issue” that people had trouble with.</p>

<p>After a while of searching I found that the issue was with the way that I had created the blast database. I had specified the option to <code class="highlighter-rouge">parse_seqids</code>. This specifies that the sequence ids are parsed into numerical format and made it so that I was unable to successfully parse them after I had finished.</p>

<p>The only unfortunate part about this is that blast is still unable to parse anything that comes after whitespace in the sequence id, so this must be converted to a different character.</p>

<p>Happy Blasting!</p>
