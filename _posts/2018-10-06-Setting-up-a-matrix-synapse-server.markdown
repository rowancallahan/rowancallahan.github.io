Whatever your reasons for installing it one thing is certain the matrix synapse reference server is an awesome solution to modern day private communication.
With federation and encryption as well as the options for video, audio and text messaging, there is nothing more that you could really ask for.
Information about various client implementations can be found [here][link1] but currently the main reference server for the protocol is called "Synapse"

There are lots of installation guides out there on the internet, and this one is as much meant for me to remember things as for an explanation to others.

Some other guides that were used along the process of making this one are the following
[guide from xyz][guideplace1]
[guide from abc][guideplace2]


first get things started by running

```bash

echo hello world

```
