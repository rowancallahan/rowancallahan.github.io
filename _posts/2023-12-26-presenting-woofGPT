##WoofGPT a breakthrough in animal language models

Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence and Large language models have promised to reshape how we work, live and think.
Despite large breakthroughs in human like intelligence animal, and in particular dog-like intelligence has proven difficult to pin down and capture.
Despite a literature search we found that almost no research had been conducted on dog language models.
Seeing this scientific gap we set out to create the first dog language model that can sucessfuly simulate a conversation with a dog.

Using a generative transformer model we are able to find broad performance across a number of open source dog language bencmarks.
Notabley we are able to achieve SOTA and beat single model performance using only a generative model without finetuning.

|                   | random_baseline | woofGPT           | single model SOTA |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| dogBENCH          | 50%             |  69%              | *71%*             |
| woofnogrande      | 50%             | *69%*             | 65%               |
| WOOF8k            | 0%              | *42%*             | 10%               |

We think that this model will democratize dog dog intelligence. 
If you don't own a dog How many times have you wanted to own a dog just to fret about the fees and upkeep in order to interact with humankinds greatest friend.
We will be releasing the training data and weights of WoofGPT publicly.
Notably we also are releasing a hosted version of the model for the public to play with below to try and experience this new intelligence for themselves.
